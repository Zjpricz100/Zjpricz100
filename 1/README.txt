Hello! Thank you for grading / checking out my project!

To run the code, all you need to do is run the run.py file while inside the 1/code directory. 

Within run.py you can colorize/plot all images by using the colorize_all_images() function or if youd like to colorize a single image, you can use the colorize_single_image() function.

Thanks!
